# Rahletak 🧭

Hey everyone! This is a travel website I built in Arabic called **"رحلتك"** (Rahletak). I created it to help users explore Egypt's most popular tourist destinations in a simple and engaging way.
This project was a great opportunity to improve my Next.js skills — especially working with dynamic routing, ISR, JSON data fetching, and building responsive UIs with Tailwind CSS.

## Project Features 🚀 :

- Fully responsive travel homepage
- Sections like Hero, About Us, Why Choose Us, Testimonials, and more
- Destination cards with details and images
- Dynamic routing for each destination page using `slug`
- NotFound page for invalid URLs
- Smooth scroll and clean navigation
- Arabic language support (RTL layout)
- Optimized for performance using Next.js App Router & ISR
- Static metadata for SEO
- Carousel for testimonials and featured destinations using Swiper.js

## Tools I Used 🛠️ :

- **Next.js 14** (App Router)
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Swiper.js** (for carousels)
- **React Icons**
- **Google Fonts (Cairo)**
- **JSON Data** (static for destinations)

---

## Data Handling 🧠:

- Destinations are loaded from a local JSON file (`/public/data/important-places.json`)
- Used ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) to keep data fresh every 60 seconds
- Dynamic routing for each place using `slug` field
- Custom `notFound()` page used for invalid slugs
